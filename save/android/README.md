# Antimatter Dimensions Android Savedata

This directory includes `Antimatter Dimensions` savedata created from `Android APP`.  
So, this may differ to what you expect to get from Web or PC clients.

## How to open and apply it?

You can just open the `.sav` file with notepad, nano, GitHub Raw Contents, or whatever you want.  
(For Android users, using GitHub Raw Contents is recommended.)  
(For PC users who're lazy, just open it and drag every content.)  
Note that this save is NOT OP(reached Endgame). This is for cross-platform gameplay and backup.

> #BUG
>
> `Antimatter Dimensions` running on Chrome for Android can't import the save  
due to the `paste-here notify` char limit.

## How can I check if it's compatible?

The `.sav` file is the save file. For web version, `.global.sav` file is also provided.  
> Android savefile begins with `AntimatterDimensionsAndroidSaveFormat` ("This update sucks" update),  
> and global one with `eyJ` ("This update sucks" update)

**NOTE** The savefile may not compatible if your game is not up-to-date or modified.

**NOTE** Android versions can load web version saves. So, some saves don't provide them.
